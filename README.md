# Tokyo-olympic-azure-data-engineering-project
Developed a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory to extract, transform, and load Olympic data into Data Lake Gen 2. Analyzed the data using Synapse Analytics and Databricks to gain insights into Olympic trends.

### Data Extraction and Loading
* Used Azure Data Factory to extract data from an Olympic data API.
* Loaded the extracted data into Azure Data Lake Storage for storage and processing.

### Data Transformation
* Leveraged Azure Databricks and Spark to transform the raw data.
* Cleaned, normalized, and enriched the data as needed.
* Loaded the transformed data back into Data Lake Storage.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
* Utilized Synapse Analytics to run SQL queries on the transformed data.
* Generated visualizations to explore trends and patterns.
